UI/UX Design Planning.
Goal	Description
Simplicity	The interface should be clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate for all users, including those less tech-savvy.
Responsiveness	The application must perform well across all devices—mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Performance	Pages should load quickly with optimized image sizes and minimal delays in interactions.
Trust & Clarity	Provide clear information about properties, pricing, cancellation policies, and customer support to build user trust.
Conversion Focused	Design should guide users smoothly through the booking process to reduce drop-offs.

✅ Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup
Reason	Explanation
Consistency	Helps maintain a uniform look across components and pages.
Developer Handoff	Enables developers to accurately implement UI based on predefined tokens (colors, fonts, spacing).
Design System Creation	Lays the foundation for scalable design systems and component libraries.
Faster Iteration	Clearly defined properties make it easier to apply global changes without manual editing.
Accessibility	Ensures contrast and readability meet accessibility guidelines.

 UI Component Patterns
This section outlines the reusable UI components that will be created to ensure consistency, maintainability, and a smooth user experience across the application.

Component	Description
Navbar	A responsive top navigation bar that includes branding/logo, navigation links (e.g., Home, Listings, Contact), and user authentication controls (e.g., Login/Logout, Profile dropdown). It will adapt for both desktop and mobile views.
Property Card	A visual card component used in the property listing view. Each card displays a thumbnail image, property title, price per night, rating, and a short description. Clicking it will navigate to the detailed property view.
Footer	A fixed or sticky bottom section of the page that includes site links (e.g., Terms, Privacy, About), social media icons, and copyright information.
Button	Reusable button components with variants such as primary, secondary, disabled, and loading states.
Search Bar	An input field with optional filters (location, date, guest count) for searching properties. May include autocomplete or suggestion features.
Booking Form	A form that includes date pickers, guest selectors, and a submit button. Used in the listing detail and checkout pages to initiate the booking process.
Modal	A reusable pop-up component for actions like login/signup, booking confirmation, or displaying alerts. Includes optional overlay and close controls.
Rating Display	A visual component to display property ratings using stars or numeric scores, typically included in cards or detail views.
Image Carousel	An interactive image slider for property photos. Includes navigation arrows, indicators, and support for mobile gestures.
Toast/Alert	A notification component for displaying success, error, or info messages across the application in a non-intrusive way.
